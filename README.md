# DeepRL
> Highly modularized implementation of popular deep RL algorithms powered by PyTorch
* Deep Q-Learning
* Asynchronous One-Step Q-Learning

>Benchmarked by classical control tasks (CartPole, LunarLander). Atari games will make it difficult to replicate in a regular laptop without a good GPU. However it's fairly easy to adapt the components to fit Atari games.
